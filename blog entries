Software engineering to me means a way for computer scientists and developers to have a chance to create something for others
that involves a bit of creativity as well as some logical thinking. It involves a lot of problem solving and to me 
that seems to be something that will fun but challenging to do at the same time. 

  Why are you taking software engineering and what do you hope to take out of the class?
I'm taking this class because I'm a computer science major, but I'm also interested 
in software and want to become a better programmer. 
I hope this class will help me with any weaknesses that I have when it comes to coding.
